**I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! I'm Pickle Rick!**

**The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them.**

**If I die in a cage, I lose a bet.**

**Listen, I’m not the nicest guy in the universe, because I’m the smartest, and being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets.**

**I’m sorry, but your opinion means very little to me.**

**Thanks, Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.**

**Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for? Just kidding, I don’t care.**

**Don’t get drawn into the culture, Morty. Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing.**

**It’s a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt.**

**Don’t move. Gonorrhea can’t see us if we don’t move. Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T. rex.**

**Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call ‘love’ is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.**

**I’m a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don’t like something about the world, I change it.**

**Weddings are basically funerals with cake**

**Get off the high road Summer. We all got pink eye because you won’t stop texting on the toilet.**

**I’m sorry, Morty. It’s a bummer. In reality you’re as dumb as they come.**

**Boom! Big reveal! I turned myself into a pickle!**

**I JUST TOOK OVER THE FAMILY MORTY! And if you tell your mom or sister I said any of this, I’ll DENY it. And they’ll take my side, because I’m a hero, Morty. And now you’re gonna have to do whatever I say, Morty, FOREVER! A-and I-I’ll go out and find some more of that Mulan, Szechuan Teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. Because that’s, that's what this is all about Morty! Th-that’s my one arm man. I’m not driven by avenging my dead family Morty, that was FAKE! I-I’m driven by finding that, McNugget Sauce. I want that Mulan McNugget Sauce, Morty. That’s my series arc Morty! If it takes 9 seasons, I WANT MY MCNUGGET DIPPING SAUCE SZECHUAN SAUCE MORTY! TH-THAT’S WHAT'S GONNA TAKE US, ALL THE WAY TO THE END MORTY! SEASON, 9 MORE SEASONS MORTY! Szechuan sauce?! 9 MORE SEASONS UNTIL I GET THAT DIPPING SZECHUAN SAUCE! FOR 97 MORE YEARS MORTY! I WANT THAT MCNUGGET SAUCE MORTY!!!**

**You heard your mom, we’ve got adventures to go on Morty.**

**Oxygen-rich atmosphere… Giant testicle monsters… Let’s keep the party going!**

**Fuck you, Summer, and fuck the government, and fuck me for letting my guard down, which I will never do again. Here's dessert. Fuck you.**

**What, so everyone’s supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?**

**To live is to risk it all; otherwise you’re just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.**

**If I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.**

**Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ‘love’ is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed.**

**Have fun with empowerment. It seems to make everyone that gets it really happy.**

**I know that new situations can be intimidating. You’re lookin’ around and it’s all scary and different, but y’know, meeting them head-on, charging into ‘em like a bull — that’s how we grow as people.**

**Morty, I need your help on an adventure. Eh, ‘need’ is a strong word. We need door stops, but a brick would work too.**

**I don’t like it here, Morty. I can’t abide bureaucracy. I don’t like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?**

**This pickle doesn’t care about your children. I’m not gonna take their dreams. I’m gonna take their parents.**

**There’s a lesson here, and I’m not going to be the one to figure it out.**

**Wait a minute! Is that Mountain Dew in my quantum-transport-solution?**

**You don’t get to tell anyone what’s sad. You’re like a one-man Mount Sadmore. So I guess like a Lincoln Sadmorial.**

**SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MOONMEN! This isn't a musical number! This is a fucking... operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low.**

**Isn't it obvious Morty? I fucked a planet.**

**I wasn't born into the God business, I fucking earned it.**
